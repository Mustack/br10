                    <p class="m_1">Battle Royale X is Ottawa's largest LAN party involving various video game tournaments. The goal of Battle Royale is to bring together future engineers and computer scientists across the Ottawa Region to share their gaming passion in a relaxed environment. Hosted on the beautiful campus of Algonquin College, this event has become an annual tradition for the university/college students in Ottawa studying not just Engineering and Computer Science, but other disciplines as well. Battle Royale offers a unique opportunity to companies to expose themselves to over a hundred engineering and computer science students from the University of Ottawa, Carleton University and Algonquin College. It has been a huge success over the past years, and this year we expect it to be even bigger and better. Battle Royale X is going to be the best yet with an increased capacity and tournament quality! We are also donating a significant portion of the surplus made to the charity Child's Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of sick children with toys and games worldwide.</p>
                    <p class="m_1">Being mainly organized by student volunteers from the Student Branches of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers at Carleton University, University of Ottawa, and Algonquin College. Battle Royale has been supported by the IEEE Ottawa Section in all of its past installments. Once again this year, the IEEE Ottawa Section is in favour of hosting events that engage students from all disciplines. We would like to thank The IEEE Ottawa Section for the support.</p>
